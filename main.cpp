Program: Math Tutor Version 6

Description: An easy math tutor for young children.

- It will generate two random numbers between 1-10 before randomly selecting between
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division via a third number.

- Uses an outer while loop until the user wishes to quit.

- Uses an inner while loop to validate the user's input for "Do you want to continue?"
accepting yes, y, no, or n as valid input.

- Uses a for loop to give the user 3 attempts to answer the question correctly. After the third
failed attempt, the correct answer will be displayed.

- After three correct answers in a row, leveling up increases the number range by 10.
- After three incorrect answers in a row, leveling up decreases the number range by 10.

- Uses a while loop to validate numeric input.

- Uses a 2D vector to store all questions which is used to later display a summary report at
the end of the program.
